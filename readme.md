## Deployment  

**Platform**: Netlify / Render
**Why**: Easy scaling, environment management, and CI/CD support  

### Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub  
2. Connect app to deployment platform  
3. Configure environment variables  
4. Run migrations  
5. Set correct URL for frontend and backend
